# Try It yourself - error handling
In this exercise we will practice:
- using `signalMethod`

## Signal Method
1. In the book presenter store
    - Implement the `setBookId` method using `signalMethod`
2. In the book presenter component
    - Remove the `effect` from the constructor
    - Instead call the `setBookId` method and pass the `id` signal by reference
